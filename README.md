## Description
MyUIC Neo is a student-made implementation of MyUIC: the student portal web application of the [University of the Immaculate Conception](https://uic.edu.ph). The focus of MyUIC Neo is to provide **better user experience** and **better user interface** for UIC students by using modern web standards and design techniques. 

It is both a [single-page application (SPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) and a [progressive web application (PWA)](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/) for smooth native-app like experience on any device whether be on the phone, on the tablet, or on the desktop.

## Why?
Information through online platforms became the norm after the start of the online class mandate. Thus, any data related to financial payments, student grades were heavily relied on the MyUIC student portal. As a student myself of the school along with others, the experience was not good and the information it provides does not utilize it very well to the point that to get the right information, you must go to a series of links which should be exposed directly in the first place.

With this, it hopefully solves the dissatisfaction and other problems experienced by the students.

## Native Application
MyUIC Neo can also be used as a mobile application both for iOS and Android with the help of [CapacitorJS](https://capacitorjs.com). Unlike the web-only version, the mobile app provides features such as offline notifications, fingerprint authentication, persistent session, and etc.

To get started, please refer to the ["Run as Android app"](#run-as-android-app) and ["Run as iOS App"](#run-as-ios-app) sections.

## Prerequisites
### Web
- Node 16 or later
- NPM

### Android
> Android compilation is optional but is required if you want to compile it as an Android app.
- Android SDK (30 and above)

### iOS
- Xcode 13 or later
- iDevice or Simulator
- Cocoapod
- CapacitorJS `$ sudo gem install cocoapods`
  - FOR APPLE SILICON MACS ONLY: `$ sudo arch -x86_64 gem install ffi`

## Installation
To run MyUIC Neo on your local computer, simply execute the following commands:

### npm
```
git clone https://github.com/nedpals/myuic-neo.git
cd myuic-neo
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite webserver at http://localhost:3000. You may login by typing `123456789012` as the student ID and `myuicneo` as the password.

#### Run as Android App
> See the [Android](#android) prequisites for requirements on how to build the Android app.

To run the app, simply run:
```
npm run start-android
```

This will build the web app, inject it's contents, and install the app to your simulator or your device.

#### Run as iOS App
> See the [iOS](#ios) prequisites for requirements on how to build the iOS app.

To run the app, simply run:
```
npm run start-ios
```

This will build the web app, inject it's contents, and install the app to your simulator or your device.

## Connecting to the real API
By default, the web server will load the mock server. The mock server is a fake "server" that emulates the real API for development and in order to avoid unnecessary load to the real server when trying out for the first time.

To use the real API, simply create an `.env` file and copy the following:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://pinkschool-api.herokuapp.com
```

Paste the contents to `.env` file and restart the web server.
